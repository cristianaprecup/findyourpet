## Task 2: Description and Feature Stories

To describe the main features of the project, we use Agile-style user stories

### User Story 1: Posting a Lost Pet
> *As a pet owner who lost my dog,*  
> *I want to post a lost pet announcement with its photo, description, and location,*  
> *So that people in the area can help me find it faster.*

###  User Story 2: Filtering Results
> *As someone who found a cat in my neighborhood,*  
> *I want to filter posts by animal type and city,*  
> *So that I can quickly check if someone has reported it missing.*

###  User Story 3: Admin Moderation
> *As a site administrator,*  
> *I want to review and approve new posts before they go public,*  
> *So that I can prevent false reports or inappropriate content.*
